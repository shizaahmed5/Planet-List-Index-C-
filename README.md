// Planet Index Project
// This was my final project for a computer science class. In this program, the user is prompted to add, delete, find, display, sort, and quit through planets and their associating information. An additional function added was that when the user prompts to quit the program, the user is given an option to send the past information to a file, in order to save the data. If the file name already exists, the user is able to overwrite or append to the existing file. When done, you can go to the file to see the data from the previous session.
